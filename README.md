**Manage your Mac's startup items at a glance.**

Birth is a free, open-source startup item manager for macOS. It gathers every background item, daemon, and login item on your system into one window, tells you *who put it there* (code-signing identity) and whether it's running right now — and lets you disable or remove any of them with one click.

> launchd is PID 1 — every process on your Mac is born from it. Startup items are your Mac's birth rites; Birth lets you decide which ones deserve to stay.

## Why

macOS scatters startup items across at least four mechanisms:

| Source | What lives there | Shown in System Settings? |
|---|---|---|
| `~/Library/LaunchAgents` | The current user's background items | Only as a vague "background items" |
| `/Library/LaunchAgents` | Background items for all users | Same |
| `/Library/LaunchDaemons` | Root daemons | Same |
| BTM login items | "Open at Login" apps | Yes, but no paths, no details |

System Settings won't tell you where the plist lives, which executable it points to, or who signed it — and third-party updaters, helper processes, and uninstall leftovers thrive on exactly that opacity. Birth tears it off.

## Features

### Login Apps (everyday)

- **Zero-permission viewing** of the "Open at Login" list — works the moment you open the app, no prompts
- Add / remove login apps (a one-time Automation permission is requested only on your first change); you can also just **drag an app into the window**
- Every app shows its **developer signing identity**, plus the background pieces it quietly installed alongside itself (a "+N items" badge, one click away)
- **Recently Removed**: removed apps stay on a dedicated sidebar page, one click to re-enable

### Advanced (audit)

- Four layers in one view: user agents / global agents / daemons / login items — third-party only by default, one click to include everything
- **Signing identities verified against certificate-chain anchors**: Apple / App Store / Identified Developer / Untrusted Certificate / Ad-hoc / Unsigned / Invalid
- **Masquerade detection**: items claiming `com.apple.*` whose signature disproves it get a red "Masquerading" badge — the most common malware persistence disguise
- Live run state (PID) and one-click enable/disable (password-free for user-level items; daemons go through the standard macOS administrator prompt)
- **Search & locate**: by name, developer, or path; type a PID and get an instant answer to "which startup item spawned this process"
- **Filter & sort**: filter by run state (running / loaded / not loaded) and enablement; click any of the five column headers to sort — the sort column and direction are remembered, Finder-style
- **Safe removal**: the job is stopped first, its plist goes to the Trash, and a backup is kept in `~/Library/Application Support/Birth/Backups`
- Property-list viewer (binary plists rendered as readable XML)

## Permissions: asked when needed, once

| Action | Permission | When |
|---|---|---|
| View the Login Apps list | None | — |
| Browse user agents / global agents / daemons | None | — |
| Enable/disable user & global agents | None | — |
| Add / remove login apps | Automation (System Events) | One prompt on first change |
| View the Login Items category | Full Disk Access | Checked once in System Settings |
| Enable/disable daemons; remove global items | Administrator password | Every operation (macOS security model) |

Missing permissions degrade gracefully: one-time setup guidance in the app, an automatic refresh when you come back from System Settings, and silence from then on.

## Install

Requires macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later. Primarily developed and tested on macOS 26; if you hit problems on earlier versions, please file an [issue](https://github.com/iAmCorey/birth/issues).

### Option 1: DMG

Download the latest `Birth-x.x.x.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/iAmCorey/birth/releases) and drag Birth into Applications. The DMG is a universal binary — it runs natively on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.

Birth is a personal open-source project and is not notarized by Apple. On **first launch**, macOS will warn that the developer can't be verified: go to System Settings → Privacy & Security and click **"Open Anyway"** at the bottom of the page — once.

### Option 2: Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iAmCorey/birth.git
cd birth
./scripts/make-app.sh
open dist/Birth.app
```

By default this builds for your machine's architecture (arm64 on Apple Silicon, x86_64 on Intel) — the fastest build and the smallest app. To build a universal app that runs on both chips (the form official DMGs ship in), use:

```bash
./scripts/make-app.sh universal
```

(A Homebrew cask is planned.)

## Development

```bash
swift test                    # unit tests
./scripts/release-check.sh    # release gate: tests → universal package → self-contained smoke launch → health checks
./scripts/make-dmg.sh         # distribution DMG
```

- SwiftUI + Swift Package Manager — no Xcode project file, zero third-party dependencies
- Three targets: `BirthCore` (scanning/control/signing, UI-free), `BirthUI` (the whole app, testable), `Birth` (a three-line main)
- `release-check.sh` must pass before every release — one red light and it doesn't ship

## Notes & limitations

- **The signing badge shows identity, not integrity**: Birth verifies certificate-chain anchors ("who signed this"); it does not hash the full bundle contents — that's Gatekeeper's job.
- **The Login Items category is read-only**: macOS offers no third-party API to toggle these items, so Birth gives you a one-click jump to System Settings instead.
- Birth currently ships with an ad-hoc signature, which changes with every build. **After upgrading, Full Disk Access and Automation permissions must be re-granted in System Settings** (toggle Birth off and back on). Within a single version, a grant persists.

## Uninstall

Move Birth.app to the Trash. For a deeper clean (optional):

```bash
defaults delete dev.birth.Birth                            # preferences
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Birth                # removal backups
```

Don't forget to remove Birth's permissions in System Settings → Privacy & Security.
